          I'm Dwayne Laughlin. I'm a lifelong Chicagoan currently living in
          the neighborhood whre I grew up on the Westside. I attended Loyola
          University Chicago, graduating in summer of 2011 with a BA in Music.
          Since graduation I have spent time working as a music teacher,
          performing pianist, composer and producer. For the last 2 years I have
          also been the current lead for the account management/collections team
          for zZounds.com, a leading company in the instrument retail business.
          Part of my day to day job is overlooking some of the coding of our
          internal wiki page and doing some light coding in HTML as well as
          using Ecometry for managing our payment sytsem and doing data entry.
